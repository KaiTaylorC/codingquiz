# codingquiz
My homework for the week, creating a coding quiz to assess the knowledge of the user on coding based questions. 
I understand that my quiz works correctly however could not create a way to keep score or get the user submit to save to local storage without recreating all new HTML and JS docs. I did not have the availability to do so without entirely deconstructing my working code.
